                <p> 1. Players rotate between being the judge (who receives red cards) and normal players (who choose
                    red cards). There is one judge per round who is given a random green card, as is displayed on
                    the host's screen. </p>
                <p> 2. Players (except the judge) quickly click the red apple card
                    from their hand that is best described by the word on the
                    green apple card played by the judge. </p>
                <p> Quick Pick Option:
                    With five or more players, you might want to try the Quick Pick
                    Option. The last red apple card that is selected will not be
                    judged and is returned to that player’s hand. If you snooze, you lose! </p>
                <p> 3. After selection is finished, selected red cards will appear on the screen along with
                    the green card. The judge selects the red card they think is
                    best described by the word on the green apple card. </p>
                <p> 4. The winning player receives a point and play continues with another green card. Each
                    player receives enough red cards to have seven total after each round. </p>
                <p> 5. Play continues following steps 1–4 until someone has earned
                    enough green apple cards to win the game! </p>
