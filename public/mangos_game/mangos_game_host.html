      <p> 1. Players rotate between being the judge (who receives red cards) and normal players (who choose
        red cards). There is one judge per round who is given a random green card, as is displayed on
        the host's screen. </p>
      <p> 2. Players (except the judge) quickly click the red apple card
        from their hand that is best described by the word on the
        green apple card played by the judge. </p>
      <p> Quick Pick Option:
        With five or more players, you might want to try the Quick Pick
        Option. The last red apple card that is selected will not be
        judged and is returned to that player’s hand. If you snooze, you lose! </p>
      <p> 3. After selection is finished, selected red cards will appear on the screen along with
        the green card. The judge selects the red card they think is
        best described by the word on the green apple card. </p>
      <p> 4. The winning player receives a point and play continues with another green card. Each
        player receives enough red cards to have seven total after each round. </p>
      <p> 5. Play continues following steps 1–4 until someone has earned
        enough green apple cards to win the game! </p>
